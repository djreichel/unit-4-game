jQuery crystal game

Coding sample by D.J. Reichel.

Rather than a straight up recreation of the Crystal Collector game utilizing art which looks like gem stones, I mixed it up with some colorful gamepieces for which to score points. I created visual contrast to those colorful gamepieces with a monotone background and game board. 

The game is still played exactly the same way as the crystal collector - setting a random target score at the beginning of the game and clicking a scoring mechanism (aka - gamepiece) to tally points to the players total score. The rules are the same - match the player score to the random target score to win - score more than the random target score and you lose.
